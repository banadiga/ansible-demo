  To be, or not to be" is the opening phrase of a soliloquy
  spoken by Prince Hamlet in the so-called "nunnery scene"
  of William Shakespeare's play Hamlet. Act III, Scene I. â€¦
  Even so, Hamlet seems to consider himself alone and there
  is no indication that the others on stage hear
  him before he addresses Ophelia.
